### BIMJSON v0.1 Rapid Prototype Phase
1. Closed source, not for redistribution to anybody beyond the listed names below until mutual consent by Kimon Onuma and Van Woods.â€Ž
The purpose is to collaborate and develop internally with a small core group without distraction or fragmentation until a coherent design emerges, to be determined by agreement of the group. The goal is to develop a more agile BIM data exchange and standardization product and process. The intent is to push for broad US adoption and to benefit the AECO industry and ecosystem.
